    <description><![CDATA[The Downtown Houston district has been completely revamped, and is now a vibrant neighborhood with more than 4,000 residents. Over the past decade, more than 4 billion dollars have been invested in the area, and as a result, the downtown area is booming with development. Over 150 restaurants and clubs have opened since 1997, and the historic district has become one of Houston’s most popular nightlife destinations. Houston has also moved many of its professional sporting arenas downtown including the Rocket’s Toyota Center and the Astros Minute Maid Park. <br><br>

    <description><![CDATA[Midtown is all about location. Situated in between Downtown Houston and the Medical Center, residents of this newly renovated and upscale neighborhood never have to travel very far.

    <description><![CDATA[Sugar Land is one of the fastest growing cities in America, and was recently ranked third on CNN/Money’s list of the 100 best places to live in the United States. This explosive growth has been fueled by the local economy which is home to Imperial Sugar, Western Airways, and a myriad of small energy and technology companies. In fact, so many corporations have been lured to the Sugar Land area that Texas Business Magazine named it the top city in Texas for business expansion and relocation.

    <description><![CDATA[Katy has a good mix of affordable housing and pricier, larger homes. Originally, Katy was a suburb that catered to those who wanted the luxury of more space (both acerage and square footage) for a fraction of the cost in the city. However, as the area has become more and more popular for both young families as well as older couples jaded of the fast paced city life, prices have begun to increase. Katy is, though, still generally more affordable than the Woodlands and Kingwood suburbs.
